# Global-Corona-Statistics-App
Link to Netlify site: https://gallant-wescoff-74ee5c.netlify.app/

I made a web app that fetches information from "https://api.covid19api.com/ using a button for Global statistics, dropdown menu for a few selected countries, and then
there is a search field to make a search for any wanted country. After fetching the data, it is shown in a table that uses colors, icons and bootstrap styling to make
the data look nice and readable.
