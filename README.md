I made a web app that fetches information from **** using a button for Global statistics, dropdown menu for a few selected countries, and then there is a search field
to make queries for any wanted country. After fetching the data, it is shown in a table that uses colors, icons and bootsrap styling to make the data look nice and
readable.
